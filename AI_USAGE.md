# AI Usage

Briefly describe how you used AI (tools, prompts, code snippets, fixes). Be concise and honest (using AI is fine; it's just a tool; we want to know your method). If you did not use AI, state that here.

1. From AI tools I only used ChatGPT.

2. I used it mostly to quickly map my previous knowledge of using Next.js and React to Angular.

- Example prompt: "Show general comparison next.js vs angular. What is similar and different."

3. I used it to learn about Spring Boot generic project structure.

- Example prompt: What is the difference between api, core, persistance and gradle folders? Why each of these has its own src and build subfolders?

4. I also used it for general questions like "why is there three separate repository classes per entity: BookRepository, JpaBookRepository and BookRepositoryAdapter".

5. Other than that I didn't use ChatGPT to generate any direct code snippets since it all seemed intuitive once I got familiar with the existing code.
